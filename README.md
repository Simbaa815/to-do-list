# To Do List

A todolist made using HTML, CSS, and JS is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks or items they need to complete. The application typically includes an input field where users can enter a new task, along with buttons to add, delete, and mark items as completed.

The styling and layout of the todolist is typically implemented using CSS, with features such as color coding, icons, and animations used to improve the user experience. The JS code is responsible for handling the dynamic functionality of the todolist, such as adding and deleting items, and keeping track of completed tasks.
